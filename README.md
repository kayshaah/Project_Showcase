# 🧠 Project Showcase

### Extension of [AI-Inspired Portfolio](https://github.com/kayshaah/k-bot)

**Project Showcase** is an expansion module of my AI-driven personal portfolio.  
It introduces a dynamic, standalone page that highlights my technical projects — blending storytelling, interactivity, and AI-enhanced visuals.

## 🚀 Overview

The **Project Showcase** page acts as a live gallery for my most meaningful work — from research papers and machine learning projects to real-world AI applications.  
It reflects not just the *projects I’ve built*, but the *journeys, decisions, and technologies* that shaped them.

Each showcased project features:
- ✨ Interactive visuals and subtle animations  
- 🧩 Clean Next.js + Tailwind UI  
- ⚡ AI-driven summaries and storytelling integration  
- 📁 Modular architecture for scalability
